Introducing the Virtual Assistant project. The backend functionality is powered by Python and Java, with Flask serving as the web framework. Voice-based interactions are facilitated by the Web Speech API, while the integration of the OpenAI API enhances the virtual assistant's intelligence and responsiveness. This project seamlessly combines these technologies to create a user-friendly and interactive virtual assistant experience.
